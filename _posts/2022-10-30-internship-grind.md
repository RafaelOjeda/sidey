&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year thousands of students prepare to apply for the Summer Software Engineering Internships. I was one of them. As a junior in college I am somewhat late to be starting my internship endevour. Balancing both school work and the search for an internship is a full time job. First, I went to resume review workshops that UPE a student organization for computer science students. I improved my resume then I made sure that my projects that I had put on my resume where up to date. After that, I applied to the masses of opportunities that are out there. Some of the companies that I applied to were; Amazon, Adobe, Microsoft, Visa, Google, L3Harris, Chewy and many more. One thing that I have learned is that even if you do well it does not mean that you will get your internship because there could be so many others that did well to. At that point you're going to chosen by luck. Another thing I learned is that I need to always be working on Leet Code and Hacker Rank problems. I will be posting my resume as the next post if you'd like to check it out.
